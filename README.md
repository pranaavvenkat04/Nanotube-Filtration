# Filtering Molecules with Nanotube Technology 
## Description
- Skills: Software Development · Python · Raspberry Pi · Electrical Design · Linux · Operating Systems

- Technology envisioned by NASA to create a filtration device to eliminate contaminants from water supplies. Originally developed to purify wastewater for reuse aboard the International Space Station, the innovation is applicable to numerous situations on Earth where there is a need to collect potable, medical-grade water from a contaminated water supply. The unique aspect of the technology is its use of acoustics rather than pressure to drive water through small-diameter carbon nanotubes.
- Designed software that controls the acoustic motor and created a menu-interface for users to control the motor's frequency to demonstrate the prototype.
